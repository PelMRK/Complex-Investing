# Complex-Investing
This project parses a lot of company data from websites for my investment strategy

Here are parser programs, user action imitators and trial genetic algorithms

I use data from three different sites: investing.com, gurufocus.com, tinkoff.ru

As a result, I get a lot of ratios and target prices for companies (these data are then used by me in another document for calculations)

"tickers.py" checks if new tickers have appeared on the exchange

"main.py" parses information, "bots" imitate user actions to collect data
